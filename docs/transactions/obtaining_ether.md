## Obtaining Ether

To obtain Ether you have two options:

1.  Mine it yourself
2.  Obtain Ether from another party

Mining it yourself in a private environment, or the public test environment (testnet) is very straight forwards. However, in the main live environment (mainnet) it requires significant dedicated GPU time
which is not likely to be feasible unless you already have a gaming PC with multiple dedicated GPUs. If you wish to use a private environment, there is some guidance on the [Homestead
documentation](https://ethereum-homestead.readthedocs.io/en/latest/network/test-networks.html#id3).

To purchase Ether you will need to go via an exchange. As different regions have different exchanges, you will need to research the best location for this yourself. The [Homestead documentation](https://ethereum-homestead.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ether.html#list-of-centralised-exchange-marketplaces) contains a number of exchanges which is a good place to start.
